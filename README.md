# TUM RCI Lecture Notes 📝

In this repository you can find lecture notes and cheat sheets for some of the courses in *Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence* at the Technical University of Munich. 

When I started my Master's in RCI in WS21/22 I could not find many good lecture notes for my courses online. I created this repo hoping that over time it will become the ressource I was looking for. Maybe it will be of help to you!
